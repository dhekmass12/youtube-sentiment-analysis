My mom use to buy all his songs on Apple Music. It confused me cause you can just listen for free literally anywhere. But her words were “I like to support him in this way. His music touches my soul.” And feel the same way but with Lady Gaga’s songs. My mom sadly passed due to metastatic breast cancer that came back in her bones. I was her only caretaker and she was all I had. She passed June 11th 2023 and I’m 19 now. This song came out and it hits me so close to home cause I wasn’t there when she passed. So yes I just wanted to hold her just for a while and for her to die with a smile. I feel like my mom sent me this song to tell I’ll be ok. Love you mom and love you Bruno and Gaga for this creating this song.,Neutral

I can't make it all the way through it without crying by the final chorus and I'm not ashamed by it at all. So far, I've yet to lose anyone quite like the lost loved one described here, but I have lost many that I've cared about, and this song really has a way of letting the grief I could never truly feel in those moments out. What a beautiful melody. It now stands as the soundtrack to my work in-progress novel from the very day it began. I look forward to returning here again whenever I need to let that grief out.

"Something that happened it was bad. I was sad. I’m just on my mom‘s account and I’m a kid. I’m only seven years old. Don’t make fun of me because I’m really sad. This song reminded me of it cause one time when I was really little I was like four or three and when I was like boy, I think now I was little and I hated my babies because they got my eyes all the time that was like your hair I cut it. It turned out bad and I wanted to go say hi but I just remembered I said oh no my hair. I’m gonna make fun of me so I want to go call him and say hi but they didn’t make fun of me because they were good people and then when I was six, I have my grandma and I called her Maga so I was in my room watching my iPad just watching YouTube scrolling down TikTok into my Maga called me over. I went just in case it was something that and she said look out the window I looked out. My friends house was on fire all I made it out. I got that happened, but the house was destroyed a lot so they had to move away, and I thought I would never see them again, but one time when I was at my cousins house they live right by us so I could go to the house walk so I was there one time in my I was in my aunt room and my cousin Alexis walked over she’s nine years old and I forgot what her birthday is but yeah and she said you know your friends across the friends yeah and I’m like yeah I know that I’m never seeing them again. I know that if they they moved, how am I supposed to know if they’re going? I’m gonna see them see them like there’s no way I’m seeing them and she said I found out the people that on my group for softball your friends on my team and I’m like please get out please get out. I was on my phone with one of my friends. Her name is Violet and yeah and Then I started crying a lot but like happy tears because I was gonna see them again and then I told my friend about it I got some tissue to wipe the tears off blow my nose she said are you OK and I’m like yeah but I’m just happy that I’m gonna see them again. I’m sad like happy tears and when I go again, I told like the middle one remember me she said yeah when he was Alexis‘s first game and then when I saw the little one, I said, I know you don’t she said yeah and I don’t remember if I have to but she’s or she is on her team again I know what I’m gonna do. I’m gonna hug them really tight because I saw them again and I’m hungry I’m so tired, but crying silently, and if one of my friends that would cross the fence, watching me are going to close my eyes and be silent crying, and I would be saying in my head. I’m so glad I asked you my cousin said that they want the team and now they are on it again. I’m so happy I got to see them. I thought I would never see them again, but when I saw them and made my day.🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹",Neutral

"This song means a lot to me. Some years ago a friend and I fell in love with each other, and this song tells the story perfectly. She and I loved each other deeply, but circumstances meant that we couldn’t be together. She was engaged to be married to her partner, and they had a daughter together who I also loved very much. She couldn’t turn her daughters life upside down, and I couldn’t have allowed that. All we wanted was to be together, but we knew we couldn’t without causing a lot of hurt to other people. We didn’t want to hurt anyone, so we had to decide that we couldn’t see each other anymore. We said our goodbyes and she married her partner, but sadly it didn’t work out for them. 16 years later I still wonder what may have happened in a world where we could have been together, and I have never loved anyone else in the way I loved her. Maybe part of me always will love her",Neutral

When u set fire to the rain I fell from the sky so fast caught my wing to flame as my feather spread to burn your note with my ink that felt like a memory I remember  of a love once a pond  time in letter  written in paper heart crush in a ball that I found roll in the street as I pick it up an it read a unfinished story of a girl that never can't find a love but yet run away from it like word falling out so deep with noone to hear her  heart sing out for it other half but she left it to a man she met in her dream she fall in love with   holding  the paper of a song she wrote him  clock strike 12 that woke her up to reality with a disappointment look on her face that it was only a dream but the feel she had for him was real but how can feel so in love a happy in her dream an feel so broken when she wakes up Hoping she will see him a again when she lay to sleep as year pass by she waiting alone  hoping an dream  he will show up one day but that was the last time she ever saw him thought to herself it was just a dream but the feel she had in her heart tell her otherwise so one day she decided to finish the song that she wrote about him hope one dayhe show up in her dream again as she open her book to finish writing she noticed that the page has been rip out from her note book but saw a word write on the other page read Hello....with a smile all I ask is a love worth remembering can u love again .he read .,Neutral

"Damn.....this hurt. It's been 3 years since the divorce and there isnt even one night I havent thought of her. It's not obsessive or possessive. It was real love and the thoughts are mostly of happy moments from the time we spent together. I cherish those memories because they were true moments in love and at the same time those memories tear me up inside because i know we could have been together forever. I fucked up by not being there emotionally and it wreaks me constantly because i could've been better, i could've been the best version of myself. Why did I have to become that outside of our marriage, our deep friendship, our everlasting connection? I am the fool. I know I am only talking to the moon. I wish I could tell you how much I still love you, I wish I could say that you finding another man that takes care of you emotionally makes me cry with joy. He was the man I could not be at that time. I still love you so much that I'm not mad, jealous or sad that you found that. I still love you so much that when I even get a glance of one of our pictures from the wedding that I dont even mean to look at I still get butterflies. ",Positive

To me, it sounds as though the person still living becomes someone who tries to drink away the pain. So much so that they truly hear the sound of their loved one talking back to them. ""In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too or am I fool?"" Some have faith and believe in heaven, but no one truly knows where we go when we die. It seems as though they are simply grieving and hoping their loved one is out there somewhere able to hear them. At least that's how I perceive this song.",Neutral

Naldo Benny sola!,Neutral
"A child is born weak in every way. Above all, he needs the affection he receives from his parents or caregivers. They are his role models, and he learns many of their habits. Over time, these habits become instinctive and are stored in memory, but he may also acquire wrong habits, such as favoritism towards siblings or other wrong habits. Religion may also be a wrong habit. A child's mind is not yet fully developed, so how can he choose a religion and learn about God at an early age? For example, reproduction in nature and science is natural. It is very likely that a child will come and worship strange things. For example, if I change my religion, leave my family, travel to a faraway country, get married, and have a child, my child will come and worship my new religion. What a wrong principle in choosing a religion! This is the greatest evidence that God created us with the heart and mind to know God when we grow up. I have a suggestion for you: Food and drink contain happy hormones. Fast for ten full days. Abstain from food and drink until sunset.  Go to your temple and repeat, fast for another ten days, go to the mosque and pray with the congregation. Read in your own language, and that's fine. Where does peace and tranquility come from when you are in direct communion with God? Life is short. How long will you live? More than a hundred years, and then you will die. Only your work will benefit you. Everyone will abandon you.",Neutral

"It’s  August 2025, and even now, I still remember her—my first love. We started talking in 2022, and over two years, something real grew between us. At least, that’s what I believed. We shared countless conversations, late-night thoughts, silly jokes, and quiet moments that made me feel like we had something special. On the night of November 19th, I finally opened up and proposed to her online. She didn’t say yes, but she didn’t shut the door either. She gave me something both beautiful and painful: hope. She told me maybe we’d be in a relationship in 2025. I held onto that for so long. That small hope became something I carried through everything—the hard days, the lonely nights, the changing years. But today, in August 2025, that hope finally broke. I saw her with someone else. Laughing. Holding hands. Happy. And the worst part? I stood there quietly, watching the girl I once dreamed of building a future with, now living a different story—one that I’m not part of. It hurt more than I want to admit. Not because she moved on—I know people grow, change, choose different paths—but because for so long, I believed that maybe, just maybe, we were still written into each other's futures. She wasn’t just someone I liked. She was the first person I ever truly loved. That kind of love doesn't fade easily. It lingers, even when it’s no longer returned. And while I know I have to move forward, I also know it’s okay to feel the sadness. It’s okay to miss what could’ve been. But I’m also learning that love isn’t just about getting someone in the end—it’s about what that person awakened in you. She taught me how deep I could feel, how much I could care, how brave I could be when I’m vulnerable. Maybe that was her role in my life—not to stay, but to show me what love looks like, even if it wasn’t mine to keep. She’ll always be my first love. Not my forever, not my ending—but a part of me I’ll always remember with both pain and quiet gratitude.",Neutral

"Zeynep Bayram, bugün senin doğum günün, ben şunu biliyorum ki bazen bir mesaj en iyi doğum günü hediyesinden daha mutlu eder insanı. Ben de şuan içimden gelerek sana bu mesajı yazıyorum, beni sevmiyorsun ,belki de hiç sevmiyeceksin ama benim tersime biri seni sevecek belki ben yalnız kalıcam ama sen biriyle olucaksın ve mutlu bi hayat yaşıyacaksın ,sen o hayatı yaşarken belki de benim gözümde göz yaşı olucak ama sakın  senin gözünde  göz yaşı olmasın ,  senin gözünde sadece mutluluk olsun hiç bir şeyin seni üzmesine izin verme... Şunu da unutma hiç kimse seni benim gibi sevemez sen sevdiklerini sanarsın ama yanılırsın, belki bir gün değerimi anlarsın , karanlıkta kimse seni bulamazsa ben bulurum çünkü benim seni bulmak için ışığa ihtiyacım yok . Birini kaybetmek kolay ama kazanmak öylemi kazanmak için emek vermek gerekir ben senin için emek vericem, sen emeği seçmiyeceğini söyledin ama olsun ben yinede emek vericem , sadece bu gün özel bir gün değil, her gün özel bir gün çünkü sen her gün yaşıyorsun ve senin yaşadığın her gün benim için değerli. Yalnızlık insana çok şey öğretir, sen gitme ben cahil kalayım . Zeynep bana, seni seven herkesin hayatının altüst olduğunu söyledin, sen seviyorum ve hayatımın altının üstünden daha güzel olduğunu biliyorum çünkü sen varsın .Sözlerimi bir iltifatla bitiriyorum . Gözlerin, gözleriniz hanımefendi sanki bir müze çünkü böyle bir şaheseri taşıyorlar , doğum günün kutlu olsun saman sarısı :)):      “aşağıya  Zeynep’in beni sevmesini isteyenler kendi dillerinde ben yazsın…”",Positive

"I remember when I was in sixth grade and I had the hugest crush on a boy, we met because of my substitute teacher due to changing my crushs seat next to mine and that's where it all began. We were best friends, he showed mixed signs, always asked for paper (to throw paper balls at his friends or me) and gave me notes and whispered in my ear something one time but I knew I could make out the word ""Ur Cute"". All of my friends were shipping me and him, he dated 2 girls that year which broke my heart. He always asked who did I like but I never found a way to tell him that I liked him. He teased me, and I even had the courage to ask for his number. (and I never talked to him because I was too scared.) Now, I'm in 7th grade. He is only in my first period, and he doesn't interact with me, or even look at me anymore. I've cried over him many times..... but ever since summer vacation our friendship was gone. I wish I told him I liked him earlier. This song always reminds me of him.",Positive

Not asking you to be submissive. I'm asking you to support the right way. Buying albums, streaming, articles, getting on radio. This is real support. If you want to bring hate because you think bts is too powerful and can't crumble, doesn't has social media and doesn't know about the hate I suggest you get out of my post. They know about it all. They keep it in. You recklessly bring more, and then tell you'll protect them. You can't protect them unless you take their phones and throw it down the gutter so they won't know about negative opinions. ]",Neutral

"bro lowkey this makes me feel so nostalgic like i feel like things were so easier in 2017 and under. everything felt so peaceful compared to the present-day US. Like of course there were problems going on as the world is never really 100% peaceful, but it was so nice to just be a kid in 2017. I can't speak for everyone of course, but 2017 was really a bounce back year for me after I had lost my grandma and 3 dogs the year prior and was still upset about all of them. So, when 2017 came around, I tried my best to be a better person in spite of respective loss and pain. This was a great year for me, and I feel like if YouTube were to start doing these again, everyone who saw them before would appreciate them for nostalgic reasons. Even thinking about the 2018 Rewind, of course it's still funny, but it's truly become something that I know I've grown to love and reminisce about. Also, seeing KSI in this after Thick of It.. Umm.. Not sure if I miss that entirely....",Neutral

YouTube make and upload a YouTube Rewind 2023 please  after 4 Years it's Barbenheimer,Neutral
And to this day YouTube copes and seeths,Neutral
"Looking back at this video there are some clear things you did wrong. Number 1 you looked at likes for almost all of your videos. Instead it should have been views. Number two, you chose the most obscure things to talk about, why would you show dance videos, the most likes they got was less then a million. And lastly this video is in English which means your showing this to a mostly English speaking crowd, but yet you chose to not target them as much and target things that had decided to not target them as much like showing t series in one of the clips, no one here cares about them meaning that would not help people connect to this video or YouTube.",Neutral
Number 2 for creator views should have been MrBeast,Neutral
2:49 gold,Neutral
glad that some of people in this vid become famous rn,Positive
This could have been ai generated,Neutral
Quoting pewdiepie in 2018 we made a dumpster fire and in 2019 we made a watch mojo video,Neutral

These were meant to be a montage using popular music of the year  with subtle references of all the popular things that happened that year with YouTubers as the actors,Positive
So this videos are the reason the dislike count was removed from public view,Neutral
In my opinion this is the worst rewind. At least with 2018 (as cringy as that one was) at least they were trying (even if they tried too hard) this one just feels effortless. This is basically 2011s rewind again.,Negative
we didnt like this either,Neutral
"We bullied them to stop rewinds, then remove dislikes ",Neutral
The sad thing about this rewind is that YouTube basically just said 'stuff you' and didn't try at all. We would've all gone back to loving YouTube Rewinds if they actually made 2019's good but nope. They just gave up. And then just ended it. ,Neutral

"Nobody understands that obviously not much could be done due to the pandemic. We look forward to the trip to the future in 2024 with a new rewind, Surprise us YT",Neutral
Remember to mail your eyes to YouTube Headquarters....,Neutral
This wasn't that bad but why make a 2020 type rewind when in 2019 we had no pandemic. Seemed like a waste of usage of the year,Negative

Feel like a slight jab at the audience. Can’t put a thump on it,Neutral
The community kinda screwed YouTube rewind tbh you'd think after years upon years creating videos appreciating the YouTube community a video about appreciating advertisers which probably helped them alot would be acceptable but no. instead you shower them with hate and Criticism calling them cringy? Even tho they tried so hard to fulfill your demands? You brought an end to one of the most exciting events happening each year while you may hate them some of us love them you pushed the YouTube rewinds off the cliff expecting for another one to come but no. They are gone for good now and the reason was us the community didnt appreciate how you made a YouTube rewind about your advertisers and not us. It was truly our fault.,Neutral
