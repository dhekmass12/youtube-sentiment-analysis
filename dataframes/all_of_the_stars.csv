"""A boy, a blond, kind, sociable, athletic boy who likes writing love poems and boxing, and who knows how to give his all to everything he does, meets a girl. A girl who is gorgeous, smart, elegant, and yet distant from everyone. Despite their differences, as they start talking to each other day after day, it seems that both of them are the same. Two sides of the same coin. The one shares his kindness unconditionally even if it hurts him, and the other is afraid to show any sort of love to anyone. Slowly the years pass by, and in three years time, they become best friends, and both develop their lifes, their minds and their bodies, one way or another. She lives in Romania, he lives in Cyprus but studies in the UK. And in christmas of 2016 he visits her for one week, but after that she decides that they should stop talking. After that, both of their lifes start evolving separately for the first time after years.""",Positive

But am I going to back down, no. The pain and the void you've left still aches and will continue to ache. My heart used to beat only for you. Now it has lost its reason to beat. It's unfortunate. Who's to blame, I dont know,  and I don't want to talk about that, it's only a few precious infinities I get with you and the night sky where I can talk to you.  Be with you, find ways to heal my heart and nurse the pain. The coincidence of my favourite book and what was in fate for you,  my love , is the sad truth. ",Neutral

"Minha interpretação é totalmente diferente e eu tenho fatos para sustentar meu argumento. A outra menina que ele magoou é ela mesma. Mas ela tentou perdoar e esquecer, apagar, mas uma parte dela ainda sofre e lembra. Essa é a outra menina. Afinal, quando essa garota estava chorando no ombro dela, elas se aproximaram ainda mais, mas até que ela mentiu. Mentiu o que? Mentiu que estava tudo bem, que não doia. Ela mentiu para si mesma isso distanciou ela dela mesma. Uma prova é a parte do final, que ela diz que ele nao teve a intenção de magoar ela, mas não faz sentido pq ele magoou a outra menina. É pq elas são uma só. E por isso ela pergunta se ele ainda ve aquela menina nos olhos dela. Ela esta perguntando se ele se lembra do quanto a magoou ou a fez sofrer como ela sempre lembra. Outra prova é que ela ve a outra menina na sua mente O TEMPO TODO e voce pode sentir pena de alguem, o que for, voce so vai sentir a dor o tempo todo se o sofredor for você mesmo. No final é tudo uma metafora para ela falar da pessoa que ela era antes de ser magoada, e como são quase como duas agora.",Neutral

Truly.Believe me however life goes on I had to find myself on spiritual way and it were difficult to go through and still there are issues hurting me.I can be an Angel but when it has to be done I can have another side maybe not everyone like it but it doesn't mean that this has to be my problem too.I thought You will all be shocked to see someone at the hospital who looks like me and I know even what You mean with telling me to finish to smoke but the more I feel pressed and near people who are pressing me I don't stop.How much strengh need a person to go through where everything seems to be wrong and others are always perfect? I am human like others only the pressure of two spieitual sides are hurting the most whiles people are playing with theyr nowledge how to put pressure on them for having money.Not everyone is meant and even not every cult whiles in the same time we have to take our fault in doing things wrong against the holy spirit where I were ignorant and wrong and seeing some people or feeling by some that they're laughing at me whiles going through hell but this even is through God to bring us to repent for what we did and do.What brought me exactly to my step in the past I can't even tell but I can tell that there is truly hell on earth if we search for it.Even the bible teach us when God said to not look back because You will be a stone.This isn't a book when we close it it's over like others but it's reality who only people can see who are going through,Neutral
