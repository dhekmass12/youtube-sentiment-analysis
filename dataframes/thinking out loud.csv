@EdSheeran My fiancé is Type 1 Diabetic and asked me once “you know what can happen with diabetes” and I responded “Don’t worry I know and I’ll push you in a wheel chair or carry you if I have to.” I’ve always loved this song but I had given up on love. Listening to it made me think I’d never find a woman I loved and trusted enough to marry. Almost being 45 getting married Sept 5 in Denmark and moving to Germany to be with her. Would be awesome if you could send my future wife a message. She loves this song and means a lot to her.,Positive

"A child is born weak in every way. Above all, he needs the affection he receives from his parents or caregivers. They are his role models, and he learns many of their habits. Over time, these habits become instinctive and are stored in memory, but he may also acquire wrong habits, such as favoritism towards siblings or other wrong habits. Religion may also be a wrong habit. A child's mind is not yet fully developed, so how can he choose a religion and learn about God at an early age? For example, reproduction in nature and science is natural. It is very likely that a child will come and worship strange things. For example, if I change my religion, leave my family, travel to a faraway country, get married, and have a child, my child will come and worship my new religion. What a wrong principle in choosing a religion! This is the greatest evidence that God created us with the heart and mind to know God when we grow up. I have a suggestion for you: Food and drink contain happy hormones. Fast for ten full days. Abstain from food and drink until sunset.  Go to your temple and repeat, fast for another ten days, go to the mosque and pray with the congregation. Read in your own language, and that's fine. Where does peace and tranquility come from when you are in direct communion with God? Life is short. How long will you live? More than a hundred years, and then you will die. Only your work will benefit you. Everyone will abandon you.",Neutral
