"This song honestly is so relatable for that person in a relationship who tries so much harder in a relationship than the other person. I was watching from the outside as this happened to my sister. She would do everything for her boyfriend. She did all of his assignment all through high school and paid for all their dates. After she got him through high school she was heartbroken when he was caught cheating but she took him back. This happened 3 times in 2 years as she continued to do all his work at he got his associates degree. When he graduated from community college, he finally dropped her. He left her pregnant and scared. I wanted to kill him. Luckily, karma caught up with him before I did. He was killed in a plane crash when their daughter was 8 months old. But ultimately, the point is that this happens with girl and guys. Please know your self worth! You are amazing ",Neutral
