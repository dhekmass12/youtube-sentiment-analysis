"I was in high school when this song came out, there was a girl in my year called Jessica who I had loved since the first year and when I heard this song it felt like the perfect words to say to her, I entered the school talent show and before I sang this song I told Jessica that I dedicate this song to her and while everyone laughed at first they were in complete silence as I sung this song and when I finished the whole place erupted and I asked Jessica to be my girlfriend, and this became our song and we had it played at our wedding and it was the song we danced together to. Sadly she became very ill and it seemed like there was no chance of her recovering, I quit my job to look after her and her health kept getting worse. One day she asked me why I stayed with her despite her failing health and all I could say was """"Cause you're amazing, just the way you are"" she asked me to sing it to her as she fell asleep which I did, she would never wake up after that. It's been nearly a year now and I listen to this song in memory of the time I spent with the woman I love and always will, forever",Neutral
