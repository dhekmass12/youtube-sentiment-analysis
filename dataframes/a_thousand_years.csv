"I remember a few years back, maybe 4 or 5. I sent a message to James on social media, i think Facebook. He had been quiet for a long time, after he said something in the media, something that nearly ruined him. I said to him, remember who you are. I don't know if was actually him that replied, but someone said thank you. Then shortly after, he got back up, big time. Id like to think my comment actually made a difference, but im just happy he came back. What a talent, absolutely superb xxx",Neutral
