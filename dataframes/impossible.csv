"Hi. I once downloaded this video/song illegally. That in my religion is a sin similar to theft, and therefore requires restitution. Therefore, I’m writing to ask you how shall I do it (you can give an account to send money, or you can just ask me to donate to charity instead). If you don’t answer this I will just donate to charity as restitution. Thanks for reading this and please answer.",Neutral
