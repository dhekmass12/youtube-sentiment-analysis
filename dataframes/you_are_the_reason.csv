Before she died, family was with us to be by her side. She looked at everyone and said: ""When someone you love has died and you think they have been taken from you, they are still with you. In your heart, your body, and your soul. They want you to be happy and carry on. I will always be here for you and show a sign every now and then when I do. I will make sure you can see me. I love you all."" She then looked at me and said: ""Oh my special boy... You will always be my number 1. Take care of your mother and your family for me. I will always be with you darling"" She had passed away with a smile on her face and hold my face still. I cried so hard I dropped to the floor and it hurt so much.

"I really f@cked up shit this last weekend for the last time.  Life has been slaughtering us both for years...well a constant battle from the cycle of bad choices since horrific childhoods.  Im so tired from the fight  and the pain this time is the worst because it was the first time we both knew what it was like to be truly loved.   The scars though etched in Stone behaviours/addictions that will always be the run too and the stick to beat the dog with.  Just wanted to send one last song to say thankyou and so long.  Just wish the final chapter for me didn't end this way.  We were wonderful, just flawed.  Their is nothing left, just agonising thoughts and sleepless night's, drowning in regret.  A life squandered",Neutral

"Listening to soothing music for comfort. Charlie Kirk was shot and killed today, I can’t stop crying. I’m 70 years old and saw the good in that young man and how much he was helping the world get to a better place. What a massive loss for us all. There is a big hole in the world that cannot be filled. God bless his family. If Charlie isn’t in God’s arms at this very moment, none of us stand a chance of getting there. RIP Charlie and much love and prayers to your family. Thanks for all you’ve done to make this a better world, it mattered. Love you and will never forget you!!!🩵",Positive
