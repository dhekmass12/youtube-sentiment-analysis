It was 2017 and I was going through chemotherapy for breast cancer. My husband drove me to all of my treatments and this song came on the car radio every time. I would get lost in the lyrics. My husband was my rock during that time and this song always reminds me how he never left my side. That’s what marriage is about. 33 years!,Neutral
you can hear the feelings in his voice ...... brings back a lot of memories ,Neutral
"Honestly, it's hard, bro, but what's certain is that telling and expressing all the problems that come up in life can calm your heart and create a feeling of relief.",Neutral

"This song reminds me of my late mother. She loved this song and we sang it on loop sometimes. If I knew she’d be gone, I’d sing this song one more time just for her. Ilysm mom.",Positive
"i used to listen to this song in around 2017, my parents would always have it on the radio. i remember my parents loving this song. then a few years later my parents got divorced. after about 4 years of not hearing this song my mom started singing it in the car. it reminded me of the good old days when my parents were together. this song makes me tear up, so thank you James Arthur for writing this, it has changed my life️",Positive

I remembered listening to Say You Won't Let Go during my 8th grade year of middle school and during summer break after I graduated from middle school. Love this song and it's so nostalgic.,Neutral
"I'm so late but I was listening to this and crying, me and my friend just recently got over an argument and this song reminds me how much I care about her and that I can't take back the mistakes I've made so I'm glad she forgave me. Those of you who have close friends, don't let them go. You never know how much you love someone until they're gone. I promise you if you're having an argument with your friend, girlfriend, boyfriend, or just family the thing that helped me and my friend was saying let's just not bring it up or talk about it anymore. It might work and it might not. Just remember if you love someone tell them there might be a point where it's too late and you didn't get the chance. Here's your advice from an 12 year old. (:",Neutral
When I was 7 I quit playing guitar. For a couple years my father taught me how to play the guitar. Genuinely I was an EXTREMELY advanced player at my age but I felt discouraged ever time I would mess up. Because of that I got upset and decided to quit. 7 years later I listen to this song in awe. It's absolutely beautiful. I sing it almost everyday and dream of playing it on the guitar.  So I went back to my father and asked him to teach me it. And here I am. Already playing the first part of it. Never give up on things that you're good at just because you are scared that you suck cause you are amazing!,Positive
