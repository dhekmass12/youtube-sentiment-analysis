"I will admit, I know next to nothing about Ed Sheeran.  Other than I'm pretty sure he was in an episode of Game of Thrones......I think.   I will also admit that I'm new to this song even though its apparently been out a few years.  But having recently heard it in its entirety, I absolutely love this song.   And I was shocked that the voice I was hearing was coming from the guy I see in this video.  Which brings up all sorts of implications and interesting revelations.  If this song had been performed by any of the many ""sexy"" singers currently performing, would the video have taken a totally different approach?  I can't help but think, it was because of Ed Sheeran's non-typical music star looks, that they took this oddly humorous and corny type music video approach.   And if I choose to delve deeper into Ed Sheeran's videos, will they all be taking this sort of theme in them?   Ed Sheeran has an incredible voice, there is absolutely no denying that.",Neutral

Big shout to Eliyas his producer without him this wouldnt come to life. I love how it shows in a very fast forward chaotic video what Persian culture is - love to those around us by feeding them and with endless love and acceptance. Persian culture is epic. If you’re lucky to have Persian friends you would know what I’m talking about. I hope in the future years ahead we can share more of our culture on the screen rather than what the regime in Iran has been doing. ️,Positive
