"My name is Delia. September 13th was my birthday, and on my birthday I listened to this song a few times. I listen to it every day. This song calms me down a bit, and makes me forget about all the problems I have with my parents, because they hate me, and they always tell me that. My wish and goal for the future is to move to America and be a businesswoman. I want to interact with people in America and make friends and a future there. But I'll have to wait until then, and cry every day...",Neutral

"Agradecimentos especiais a: The Hintertux Glacier, Áustria; Hohenhaus Tenne e Hotel Neuhintertux. Sobre Ed Sheeran: Ed Sheeran pode ser o astro pop por excelência da década de 2010: um cantor e compositor internacionalmente aclamado e multipremiado que parece não reconhecer fronteiras entre estilos ou eras, com elementos de folk, hip-hop, pop, dance, soul e rock presentes em sua música. Seu incrível catálogo inclui os álbuns de estúdio ""+"" (mais), ""x"" (multiplicar) e ""÷"" (dividir), que geraram singles de sucesso como ""The A team"", ""Lego House"", ""Sing"", ""Thinking Out Loud"", ""Photograph"", ""Shape Of You"", ""Castle on The Hill"" e ""Perfect"". Em 2019, Ed Sheeran lançou o abrangente 'No.6 Collaborations Project', que contou com uma ampla gama de artistas, incluindo 'Justin Bieber', 'Camilla' Cabello', 'Travis Scott', 'Eminem', 'Cardi B', 'Paulo Londra', 'Bruno Mars' e 'Stormzy', entre muitos outros, produzindo sucessos como 'I Don't Care', 'Beautiful People', 'South of The Border' e 'Take Me Back To London'.",Positive
