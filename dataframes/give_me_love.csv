Here's what I interpreted from this video:,Neutral
"All I can hear is Caroline saying “Well, I’ve had some training, I happen to be Miss Mystic falls” ",Neutral
August 2025 anyone?,Neutral
This is definitely the most thought provoking of Ed's videos. She who helps others find love cannot find love herself and she ends up dying until someone can learn to love her as she is. Touching and one of the most beautiful song-video combos I've ever seen. This director is a genius.,Positive
This song goes out to all of the single matchmakers out there. You know who you are.,Neutral

When I heard this song for the first time I was going through a dark time and suffered depression and feeling suicidal but my life has turned for the better now after 3/4 years.:),Positive
"I've played this song so many times, and I never watched the video because music videos disappoint me sometimes, but now that I seen it I have to say I had a completely different interpretation of this song when I first heard this song I never thought of ""boy and girl"" type love or any romantic love this song went soooo much deeper than that for me. I thought of broken hearts and broken people who need love like homeless people, orphans, people who battle terrible diseases,  prostitutes, addicts, victims of abuse, and over all people who are just lonely inside and tend to look for love were it doesn't exist. I have cried to the words of this song, this song goes so much deeper than a relationship or falling in love. It's about LOVE in general.  ",Neutral
This song makes me believe in love again and I hope someday I will find  someone special again ,Positive

LYRICS,Neutral
one of my favourite ed songs ,Neutral
2023 and this masterpiece still moves something deep inside me ,Neutral
She’s always helping others fall in love but getting no love in return this is exactly how I feel with my roommates so I’m done. Time to refocus on me again.,Neutral
This is some deep fucking shit right here,Neutral
"She was very lonely and sad, looking for her purpose in life, until she discovered about ""Love"", how wonderful love is, HER WINGS REPRESENTED HER LOVE AND CARE, so she sets out to give love and help people find love, the ones she helped some found love and it worked well, others not so much, even so, at least they have/had loved which was better than not having loved at all, she became desperate and kept giving herself to just about anyone, but these people always end up loving someone else (hence the scene where she was stabbing people). Not having a love and not having someone love her back, made her feel life is not worth living, so she GIVES UP and STOPS LOVING, her death in the scene I think is more of a symbolism, when a person stops their own heart from loving or caring at all, or just gives up hope about finding love. In the scene when she was totally unconscious a man came into her life and finally made her heart BEAT again, and this time she sees him, and is a symbol for her loving him, him being the object of her affection. He caused her to live again. - That is my interpretation.",Positive

How I saw this was that she was Cupid and was tired and sad of being alone. She lives making others around her fall in love while she is left with nothing. She tries to kill herself but it doesn't work and she wakes up to the cop looking at her who I believe is her love. They found eachother in a hopeless place which is sad as well as beautiful ,Neutral

"I want to say the video is about a matchmaker that can only give lovers to other people, but wondering who's going to give her one. So in the end she stabs herself with her own arrow to see if it'll work. ",Neutral
"I remember when I first watched this video, and felt the deep deep ache of longing in her eyes as clearly as my own. I have this now, but back then, it’s all that I wanted. True deep touch and love, being held. I kept this song to myself, because I was afraid it was wrong to watch strangers kissing strangers, boys kissing each other, girls kissing each other. But it was all right there. My longing, my need. It didn’t matter the gender, I wanted love. The desperation causing her to drive that arrow into her own heart- I remember it still, and smile. Because it was possible all along.",Neutral
"It's been years since I listened and cried to this song for the first time. I'm an adult now, and I still haven't experienced love. No one kissed me, no one held my hand, no one told me they love me. I'm still waiting and screaming to God to give me love, just now with more longing.",Positive

All she wanted was love. She had the ability to give it to everyone else but she couldn't find any for herself and it grew lonely. Quite ironic actually. This is any actual fear and an actual thing. The fear of being alone and I don't care who u are no one deserves this. No one,Neutral

"I don't know if anyone had this idea already but well... I think that she is able to make other people fall in love with each other but when she tries to do it herself it won't work. When she hits other people with the arrow it dissapears and they fall in love but if she would do this to herself she'd die. She knows that and that's why she's never done it. Also a reason why she's unable to fall in love. But one day she can't take it anymore, like, she's so desperate and she want's to be loved by someone (Give me love) that she's like ""I don't care anymore"" and kills herself. But that woulnd't explain the part when the policeman enters her house and finds her so the arrow which killed her dissapears. Maybe she also wasn't able to hit herself with that arrow because she never found the true one for her. Like, she goes around and searches for her other half and on that path she sees all these people who belong together and she helps them. But in the end she just kills herself with the arrow (because, just like I said, that's what willl happen if you didn't find your soulmate and hit yourself with it). But in the end this policeman enters the room and she kind of sees him and bam, she found her other half and the arrow dissapears just like it did with the other people. Sorry for grammar mistakes or something like that, I'm from germany",Neutral

She, herself, cannot find love.  So she goes to this party hoping someone will notice her but no one does.  She goes home and puts and arrow in her neck not trying to commit suicide but she does.

Why does this song hit different now?,Neutral
"I am a Christian teacher and I think many of you are not taking the time to examine what scripture says about something. I did this as well, before attending school. The Bible was written by many authors and over different time periods. So, if you don't understand the author or his audience you may take versus to mean something they don't. First of all the old testament is just that the old law. It does say in the Bible that being homosexual is a death sentence for your soul. However, that is not what should be focused on at all. The number one thing a Christian must do is love everyone as they love themselves. Next they are to cast judgement on no one that is a job only for God. The reason this job is God's and his alone is because all humans are ruined by sin and second only God knows why he made someone the way they are. Yes, God creates us all and for his purpose, all through out the Bible it tells of God turning peoples hearts both towards and against things. God does not want people to sleep with children for any reason. During Mary and Joesph time the life span was roughly 40 years and for a girl to be married at a young age was normal and a means of creating generations to come. God does not endorse hate and judgement on others, Instead he made his greatest law the one to love one another..unconditionally. My God is your God and he loves us all and in his eyes we are all his children. Rather we like it or not. Maybe we should spread the love instead of bashing God.",Neutral

I only want a genuine kind of love  Bakit yung nahahanap ko yung inaabuso yung kabaitan ko?  Bakit kung kelan ako buntis dun moko paulit ulit sinasaktan? Ganun mo ba kami kagustong mawala? Oh kahit minsan di sumagi sa utak mo yung salitang mahal mo ako at yung magiging anak mo?  Gusto mo ba ko makunan para wala Kang responsibilidad? Kase palagi nalang Kitang nahuhuling may Iba kahit Ilang beses ko ng hiniling sayo na Sana wag mo ng gawin yung ganyang bagay  Bakit ganto?  Deserve ko ba lahat ng sakit na nararamdaman ko? Nagmamahal lang naman ako ,Positive

It took me until now to realize what this is about. The woman in this video is an empath. INFJ. The earth angel personality. The children of psychopaths that were born with empathy. They give people what they emotionally need. The sleepy eyed look in the club was her dropping out of body. The INFJ in chaos. They can’t get what they can give. They give others what they want and need. The out of body experience was the foretelling of her suicide. She killed herself with the love she gave.,Neutral

To add to this comment the out of body experience. She gave what she can’t have. But it’s a covert contract. The expectation is that her needs will arrive as a result. Now she is surrounded by people in love as a result of her work but she is more deeply in despair. It’s the knife that cuts twice. It’s only more miserable to see the incredible things you do for others and you’re still invisible surrounded by others enjoying what you have done. The out of body looks like she is turning evil. It’s not so. She gave what she needed most and the hole is deeper. There is only one thing left to do and that is to pierce herself with her own arrow.,Neutral

It's not some ordinary day -  Lilly has passed and everybody is going to be at the funeral so Jack bar is closed today. Another bad news John is Vince is back in a town, who is Wes twin.

"I know what it feels like to be her. INFJs die inside when they can’t express emotions. You can call it bipolar but no one can understand. We love like stars. We cannot find others that are wanting of this often. We give what we need so we can feel it through them but now everyone is fulfilled and the emptiness deepens. We are hypersexual love machines. We are patient not perverse. If you cannot share your light you either create art, thrill seek or become a Cupid. The core need is to emote. We can’t ever get enough of it unless there are other more pressing needs. The earth angel is content with just love itself.",Positive
