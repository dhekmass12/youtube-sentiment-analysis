What I always thought this Rewind should be was to take popular YouTubers over the year and have them do something in the videos which relates to what they’ve done on there YouTube channels. They have done that a little in the past but showcase that YouTuber in that way.,Neutral
Remember when we had a dislike button that actually worked? lol,Positive

"Looking back at this video there are some clear things you did wrong. Number 1 you looked at likes for almost all of your videos. Instead it should have been views. Number two, you chose the most obscure things to talk about, why would you show dance videos, the most likes they got was less then a million. And lastly this video is in English which means your showing this to a mostly English speaking crowd, but yet you chose to not target them as much and target things that had decided to not target them as much like showing t series in one of the clips, no one here cares about them meaning that would not help people connect to this video or YouTube.",Neutral

"We bullied them to stop rewinds, then remove dislikes ",Neutral

The community kinda screwed YouTube rewind tbh you'd think after years upon years creating videos appreciating the YouTube community a video about appreciating advertisers which probably helped them alot would be acceptable but no. instead you shower them with hate and Criticism calling them cringy? Even tho they tried so hard to fulfill your demands? You brought an end to one of the most exciting events happening each year while you may hate them some of us love them you pushed the YouTube rewinds off the cliff expecting for another one to come but no. They are gone for good now and the reason was us the community didnt appreciate how you made a YouTube rewind about your advertisers and not us. It was truly our fault.,Neutral
