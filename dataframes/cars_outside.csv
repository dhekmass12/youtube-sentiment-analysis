James Arthur don’t ever change,Neutral
I find myself crying every time I listen to this song. It goes deep into my soul. I feel like a wreck.,Neutral
"This song is for all the people who are in a long distance relationship, for all the people with demanding jobs that pulls them away for their lovers, and for all the people who are looking for someone to feel this much deeply about. Just a masterpiece ",Neutral

"As a person who is in a distance relationship ,i feel every word of this song. James never disappoints ️️",Neutral
"‪0:33‬  Every time I listen to this song, memories of that person come to mind and my tears start falling without me being able to control them. This is because the song carries a lot of meanings and feelings. It is not an ordinary song.",Neutral
"When he said, ""I'm tired of loving from afar,"" i felt that..",Neutral
"I'm single af but this song omg, I didn't cry but it makes me emotional everytime and even makes me feel like I'm the one in a relationship! This proves once again how much music can move us. I'm not usually an emotional person but with the right song and delivery, it hits deep. Not just about being emotional but the right songs help lift my mood when I had a bad day.

Only James Arthur can take a sad heartbreak or feeling and make it sound so beautiful! ,Positive
its so cool when a james song starts trending bc its like its finally getting the recognition thats well overdue and only when its trending do people realise how good james’ music is but yk what he deserves he deserves to get recognition for everything he does. whether its all the sywlg stuff or the more rock/rap influenced stuff bc hes just so good at all of that but when people see ‘james arthur’ they just immediately think of the sad love songs bc they haven’t been shown any different. i don’t understand why when james songs keep trending people don’t go ‘ooh i should look into this singer further’ bc they really should - they don’t realise what they’re missing out on. HE NEEDS TO WIN A FUCKING BRIT AWARD HE NEEDS HIS SONGS (that aren’t rewrite the stars and sywlg) PLAYED ON THE RADIO,Neutral

This song reminds me of my ex. Fardin if you’re seeing this. I’m sorry and I really loved you. I don’t regret loving you. I’m sorry that I didn’t get back to you but it was for our best. Ik you think I left you for someone else but I didn’t. I cannot accept the disrespect but that one disrespect doesn’t overshadow your love for the past 4 years. I genuinely miss our bonds and I know no one will love me like you did but I’m sorry I don’t love you anymore. I hope you get all the love you deserve that I failed to give you,Neutral

"Essa mensagem vai pro menino que mais amei... desculpa por tudo, por tudo, por todas decepções que te fiz causar, por todas as minhas faltas de maturidade, por ser uma menina teimosa e igoista, desculpa por ter feito vc sofrer algum dia, nunca foi minha intenção um dia te machucar é...agora enxerguei o quanto sua ausência tava me destruindo por dentro e causando um vazio, eu me odeio por n ter sido o amor pra sua vida, todos os dias eu me culpo por n ter sido o suficiente pra isso, por n fazer as coisas certas e tava pensando vc fez bem se afastar de mim eu queria me afastar de mim... sou uma pessoa horrível, so queria que tudo isso passasse so queria passar uma borracha em ""nos"" nem teve ""nos"" mais aprendi que pra esquecer alguem n significa apagar as memórias com ela e sim aprender viver sem ela, entt acho que to aprendendo mesmo que doa eu to aprendendo, eu to aqui falando que fui uma pessoa horrível neh mais e se vc enxergar o seu lado? Pq vc falou que me amava e no outro dia simplesmente tacou um fds nos meus sentimentos e ja assumiu outra, pq mesmo vc sabendo que ainda tinha sentimentos vc ta com outra que supostamente é minha amiga, pq vc n tem consideração por mim? Pq que vc sempre me culpa das coisas mais nunca viu o seu lado da história, sim eu sei que errei mais eu n errei sozinha queria que vc pedisse desculpas pra mim, vc sabe o quanto chorei naquela noite? Vc sabe qual noite, se vc soubesse o quanto me senti destruída por dentro vc se odiaria, pq vc nunca pensa em mim? N que eu queira ser a coitada da história mais custa pensar um pouquinho em mim? Ah mais tudo bem ninguém pensa em mim, as pessoas vao embora da minha vida e nem se importa nos meus sentimentos, eu sou uma inútil que odio de mim...",Neutral
