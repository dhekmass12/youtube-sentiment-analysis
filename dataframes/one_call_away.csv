Who is listening 'one call away' in 2024?! ,Neutral
"As someone who has been a fan of Charlie since . . . like 2009, it's been really weird and really awesome to see Charlie go from kind of, sort of famous, to extremely famous in just a matter of months. I remember watching (and downloading an MP3 to iTunes) of Sexy Shades 1, 2, and 3 and ""Do the Charlie Puth""  and ""Brady the Dog"" song and then listening and loving ""Tangerine Dreams"" and ""Kiss Me Before I Lose My Fucking Mind"" and it's crazy to see how much he's grown as a musician. I just wanna say how proud of I am of him to see him grow this much. And even seeing him on Ellen and getting a deal from singing a beautiful cover of Adele's Someone Like You. It's insane. But I also miss those videos too, because they were what made me love him to begin with. Especially the ones that were supposed to make you laugh (I Bet You Can't Watch This Without Laughing . . . or something like that) and the ones that kind of showed the guy behind the piano. ",Positive
