James is probably the most impressive songwriting talent to come out of the TV competitions in the last decade...

"Going a tough heartbreak right now, my girlfriend of two and half months left.. yeah I know what everyone’s gonna say ( two months isn’t nothing ) but those two months felt like eternity. The hugs, the kisses, the laughs, the moments where time would just stop and I would stand there and witness that beautiful smile and just burst in tears because I realized how lucky of a guy I was.. and now all I have left is our 3 month old son ace ( he’s a dog ). He means the world to both of us and she let me have him. I asked her to let me keep him because really he’s the only thing that keeps me close to her and he’s what gives me hope that she’ll come back... she told me she still loves me and she still has feelings.. she says she wants to come back but something is holding her back.. and I think it’s her ex.. come to find out when she left she started talking to him again... and she told him her feelings never faded from him.. I confronted her about it and now she ( wants time to herself ) and she’s not making a decision till she’s ready.. and right now listening to this song just reminds of the night we took a drive out.. singing this together and looking at eachother and just admiring eachother.. guys I really do love this girl.. throughout the time I’ve known this girl I’m really happy to say I found the one.. she’s my key to happiness.. I want a future with this girl.. I want to buy a house together, I want to get married, I want to have beautiful children with this girl, I want to raise our children together, I want to watch them grow older and graduate and watch them go on their way to college, I want to grow old together, I want to die together. I want everything with this girl.. hope, hope is all I have at this point.. Vanessa montalvo I love you so much.. please come back.. your family needs you, I need you.. please.. ",Positive

This Song That Really Touched My Heart And It Makes Me Want To Have Tears Of Joy.,Positive
Theory:,Neutral
"Had a girlfriend about 3 days ago who broke up with me for personal reason that i wont discuss for her own privacy. We were together for about 9 months and theres no amount of words i can put together in a sentence that can describe how much i loved this girl. As far as i can remember, this is one of the first songs that she sent to me that was a love song. It felt like she was personally asking me to never let her go, which I never ever wanted to do. I decided to learn it on my guitar and play it back for her as she sung the lyrics. Now that we are apart, i frequently come back to this song and remeber not only those times, but the entire 9 amazing months we were together. I never thought a song that could make me feel so special to her could now damn near bring me to tears listening to it, but i guess thats a bit of a cliche to say huh? ",Positive

"Love this song, tuff but, Before you scroll  We have all sinned (Romans 3:23), and the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). But God loved us so much that He sent Jesus to die and rise again (John 3:16). If you repent and trust in Him, you will be forgiven and have eternal life. He is alive today, changing lives!

"I think am I in love with a woman I barely know!! We met at church my first day back from a long absence due to work. Months earlier I prayed to God to bring a woman with certain qualities into my life. When I got there that morning there she was standing with the brightest brown eyes and radiating smile looking towards me! My soul jumped right then and there. We’re getting to know each other. She’s the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen, that’s not the best part about her. When we are standing eye to eye looking into them brown eyes I see the most caring loving selfless beautiful soul!!!!",Positive
