"This song means a lot to me. Some years ago a friend and I fell in love with each other, and this song tells the story perfectly. She and I loved each other deeply, but circumstances meant that we couldn’t be together. She was engaged to be married to her partner, and they had a daughter together who I also loved very much. She couldn’t turn her daughters life upside down, and I couldn’t have allowed that. All we wanted was to be together, but we knew we couldn’t without causing a lot of hurt to other people. We didn’t want to hurt anyone, so we had to decide that we couldn’t see each other anymore. We said our goodbyes and she married her partner, but sadly it didn’t work out for them. 16 years later I still wonder what may have happened in a world where we could have been together, and I have never loved anyone else in the way I loved her. Maybe part of me always will love her",Neutral
