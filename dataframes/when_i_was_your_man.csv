Lost my girlfriend on December and we were together for a whole year and was looking forward to what we had in the future but she said she fell out of love. I was heart broken and depressed that I didn’t finish 2020 off with someone I loved and cared for so much about. My mental issues got worst and my appetite got smaller so I started to become skinnier. I was made fun of for being skinny too. I got no one to motivate me or make me feel comfortable anymore. Friends are here once in a while but they do very little compared to what she did. I just started playing this song and all the memories come flooding back. As much as i hate the thought I hope she has a good life with someone who can support her better. Hopefully there’s someone out there for me .but I really doubt it,Neutral

"my last relationship was 8 years ago and we broke up cause we were young and dumb, even tho we had random fights for stuff that didnt make sense since we were teenagers. I miss her to this day and I wish we could've met later cause she made the first move, got me hooked, the most important thing was that she made me feel wanted to the point that left an impact on me, I tried to reach back a few weeks ago and I was greeted with a small talk only to be blocked a few days later (probably her current bf), I wanted to be selfish and ask her if she wanted to go out take a coffee and talk after so many years but I guess shes the one that moved on and I haven't yet. this song was both a blessing and a curse because this song alone made me reach out to her lol shits a banger when im not sad tho",Neutral

"They had the right idea, not the right recourse.  We were not over there for oil. A lot of people think we were but we were not.  It was for opium. Number one place that grows opium is.... can you guess? Afghanistan. We had company's of men guarding fields. Talaban tried to light them on fire and then we got them as a terrorist organization.",Positive
