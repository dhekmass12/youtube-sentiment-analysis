My mom use to buy all his songs on Apple Music. It confused me cause you can just listen for free literally anywhere. But her words were “I like to support him in this way. His music touches my soul.” And feel the same way but with Lady Gaga’s songs. My mom sadly passed due to metastatic breast cancer that came back in her bones. I was her only caretaker and she was all I had. She passed June 11th 2023 and I’m 19 now. This song came out and it hits me so close to home cause I wasn’t there when she passed. So yes I just wanted to hold her just for a while and for her to die with a smile. I feel like my mom sent me this song to tell I’ll be ok. Love you mom and love you Bruno and Gaga for this creating this song.,Neutral
