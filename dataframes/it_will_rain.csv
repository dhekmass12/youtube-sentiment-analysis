"My son had been gone 3 weeks when this song came out . Until you tasted the tears of losing  your precious frist born son.  He was such a kind soul , with so much joy and love and light . He made the mistake of taking the blame for his friends,  went to jail for them . Got a bad name and died waiting for help 2 hours from help that only had to go a few blocks .  But vengeance is God's.  He sees all things  Louie G Jimenez September 13 1987 left October 17 2011.  He love this guy right here . He was one of his favorites that became mine .

"In 2023, I lost my maternal grandmother 18 days before my birthday. I was already a big fan of Bruno, but I didn't listen to It Will Rain much. On the day of the wake, I was devastated, lost, it seemed that from the moment I lost her, everything became darkness. I was in the garage, browsing TikTok, and suddenly a video of this song appeared, and from that moment on, Bruno Mars became my comfort singer. I ended up falling into depression, but Bruno's songs helped me overcome this pain... In September I will turn 15 and I will pay tribute to my dear grandmother, exactly with this song, the song that appeared on the day she was hospitalized and she passed away, this song could have a sad meaning for me, but it gave me the strength to continue.",Neutral

This song fr... Honestly... It's about me. Cause I've been threatening to make the stupid choices that would destroy my life and everything I got for myself. If I walk away from myself and choose other worthless people over me. There would be no sunshine there would be no clear skys. The world would be over. I've been feening for what I don't need at all. That's why I stopped talking to these and those. Those are the people I was warned to stay away from my whole life. It's like I'ms throw away everything for what. Something I already have someone that's not worth shit fr.... I love me so much more than that I'm so sorry I've been threatening to leave myself for a fucking action literally when... That action with that person is trash. Probably got and I could go off but that's beside the point. Idgaf. Do whatever you want. I'm not choosing anyone over me. I love myself way to much. And I'm worth way more than that. I'm not one of them they keep trying to convince me I am. I'm not. I'm so much better and if I'm going to be happy I gotta just. Stay cozy and chill. The right one will come alone I'm patient. Af. I been waiting I can go a few a lil more. I'm so happy. Im not choosing anyone over me. Not at all. Idgaffffff. Nope. Not over a..... Na. I love you Angel. The most.,Neutral
