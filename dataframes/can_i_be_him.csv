I’ve been thinking us abt a lot lately and I think earlier the better. So these days like the past 2 weeks I realised that I still love Milan every time I see him at school I always wish we are together and uk that’s not right cuz I’m with u currently and I knew that if Milan comes to me back I gotta let u go and go to him cuz I love him and I still can’t really move on and to think about it we were really better as friends ra being in relationship just ruined it. I really feel soo bad for giving u mixed feelings and ik we promised all those but I can’t I’m sorry I still have hope that Milan might come back and I still talked everything to my friends about it so I don’t want u to be like that waiting for me and all it’s just getting harder for me every time that I don’t know what I should be doing. U treated me soo good but I still choose Milan that I again realised that I liked u as a friend only and I want us to be that and I couldn’t love u enough. That’s the reason I wanted to keep it lowkey and didn’t post u at all. When u told u wanted to meet and stuffs I felt uncomfortable so I didn’t wanted to meet u. I felt like I only accepted you cuz I was kinda feeling guilty abt giving u mixed signals like kisssing and letting u wait a lot I don’t even feel like call and talking cuz it makes me feel bad making u fall more and all and ik it’s kinda late for all this but I’m sorry I can’t do anything I’m still willing to wait for Milan and choose him again the 3rd time I still have hope that maybe he is gonna come back I still stalk him check his repost follow him text him sometimes to make sure his fine and it feels so wrong doing that fr. I didnt mean to play you and I didnt tend to do it but at first i really thought i would fall for you slowly but turns out making it even harder to meet each other for me. It was best for us to stay as friends not lovers im really sorry about all these stuffs… if i dont say it now im doing it more wrong to you and i dont want to continue that i understand if u wanna hate me now since it was all my fault even I hate myself for making you feel this way I’m so sorry karma.,Neutral

"Daniel, esta dediquei á você, te vi pela primeira vez enquanto descia uma escada, você era tão fofo e depois de um tempo começamos a fazer um curso juntos e então mudei pra sua sala, na primeira semana do curso uma professora distribuiu corações de papel pra acharmos uma dupla, eu não preocupei ninguém, e quando vi você colocou o seu na minha mesa completando, você tava tão tímido e fofo naquele dia, depois daquilo você não falou mais comigo, mas eu tentava me aproximar mesmo assim…foram 3 anos assim, eu era tímida demais e seria estranho dizer que eu te observava, mas eu sabia que você tava mais na minha amiga que em mim e eu entendo ela era linda, eu ainda lembro do dia 3 de setembro, no caso o seu aniversário e mesmo que eu não mande mensagem eu sempre te desejo um feliz aniversário, eu realmente te amei mas não era confiante e tão pouco me achava bonita portanto meu lindo par de olhos azuis…eu espero que você esteja bem  eu ainda penso em você com carinho e amor, mas hoje em dia eu sei que não fiz nada pra demonstrar oque eu sentia no ensino médio, e já vou fazer 21…precisei esquecer e seguir em frente, vi uma foto sua um tempo atrás e você mudou muito…lembro que quando você começou a fazer academia eu jurava que aquele menino magrelinho  não teria músculos mas eu estava enganada demorou mas você tá bombado kkkkkkkkkk",Neutral

"I was jealous because my bestfriend dated a man that I like. I tried to make him notice me since the start, but then he like my bestfriend. And at her birthday, I tried to get close to her boyfriend, but then I realized that he was cheating. I tried to tell my bestfriend that he was cheating on someone, and I force him to give him the password of his phone. And when we check his phone, he was cheating with a man. He was gay, and he didn't loved my bestfriend. And the most saddest thing is, it happened on her birthday..",Positive
