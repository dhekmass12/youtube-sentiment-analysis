When a person from birth can compare the electrical frequency of the brain to the frequency of a any note and accurately determine the hertz of a sound wave. And at any moment can reproduce both a pure A and A flat, A flat flat by a third and a quarter tone absolutely without difficulty. And one of them - our Charlie Winnie the Puth)",Neutral
