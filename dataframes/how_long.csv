"I am NOT a songwriter by any stretch and I know I'm like  8 years too late, but let's just appreciate what he's doing here. The verses are the guy's perspective -- he's cheated and been caught so now he's trying all the typical lines (Ok, I was wrong but can't you blame my head and not my heart, I didn't mean to hurt you, there were no feelings for this other girl involved I promise). The pre-chorus poses the question: was his cheating real or just for show; that's the bridge in between HIS perspective and HER perspective. It's question she's asking but he's hoping he can convince her to take him back, that it didn't mean anything. But then the chorus shows up and it's all her perspective: you've been creeping around on me while calling me baby. She's accusing him of being two-faced (which we already know from his perspective in the verses that he is!). SUPER well written song with a fun, unique perspective on storytelling. And that's not even touching the fact that the music and melody is epically catchy.",Neutral
