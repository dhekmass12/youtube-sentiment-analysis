"Hey you, I have something really IMPORTANT to tell you. If you are reading this I just wanted to tell you that you are beautiful and  someone out there care's about you <3 I hope you have a beautiful day/or that you've had one, because you really deserve it <3",Positive
"It’s  August 2025, and even now, I still remember her—my first love. We started talking in 2022, and over two years, something real grew between us. At least, that’s what I believed. We shared countless conversations, late-night thoughts, silly jokes, and quiet moments that made me feel like we had something special. On the night of November 19th, I finally opened up and proposed to her online. She didn’t say yes, but she didn’t shut the door either. She gave me something both beautiful and painful: hope. She told me maybe we’d be in a relationship in 2025. I held onto that for so long. That small hope became something I carried through everything—the hard days, the lonely nights, the changing years. But today, in August 2025, that hope finally broke. I saw her with someone else. Laughing. Holding hands. Happy. And the worst part? I stood there quietly, watching the girl I once dreamed of building a future with, now living a different story—one that I’m not part of. It hurt more than I want to admit. Not because she moved on—I know people grow, change, choose different paths—but because for so long, I believed that maybe, just maybe, we were still written into each other's futures. She wasn’t just someone I liked. She was the first person I ever truly loved. That kind of love doesn't fade easily. It lingers, even when it’s no longer returned. And while I know I have to move forward, I also know it’s okay to feel the sadness. It’s okay to miss what could’ve been. But I’m also learning that love isn’t just about getting someone in the end—it’s about what that person awakened in you. She taught me how deep I could feel, how much I could care, how brave I could be when I’m vulnerable. Maybe that was her role in my life—not to stay, but to show me what love looks like, even if it wasn’t mine to keep. She’ll always be my first love. Not my forever, not my ending—but a part of me I’ll always remember with both pain and quiet gratitude.",Neutral

"Zeynep Bayram, bugün senin doğum günün, ben şunu biliyorum ki bazen bir mesaj en iyi doğum günü hediyesinden daha mutlu eder insanı. Ben de şuan içimden gelerek sana bu mesajı yazıyorum, beni sevmiyorsun ,belki de hiç sevmiyeceksin ama benim tersime biri seni sevecek belki ben yalnız kalıcam ama sen biriyle olucaksın ve mutlu bi hayat yaşıyacaksın ,sen o hayatı yaşarken belki de benim gözümde göz yaşı olucak ama sakın  senin gözünde  göz yaşı olmasın ,  senin gözünde sadece mutluluk olsun hiç bir şeyin seni üzmesine izin verme... Şunu da unutma hiç kimse seni benim gibi sevemez sen sevdiklerini sanarsın ama yanılırsın, belki bir gün değerimi anlarsın , karanlıkta kimse seni bulamazsa ben bulurum çünkü benim seni bulmak için ışığa ihtiyacım yok . Birini kaybetmek kolay ama kazanmak öylemi kazanmak için emek vermek gerekir ben senin için emek vericem, sen emeği seçmiyeceğini söyledin ama olsun ben yinede emek vericem , sadece bu gün özel bir gün değil, her gün özel bir gün çünkü sen her gün yaşıyorsun ve senin yaşadığın her gün benim için değerli. Yalnızlık insana çok şey öğretir, sen gitme ben cahil kalayım . Zeynep bana, seni seven herkesin hayatının altüst olduğunu söyledin, sen seviyorum ve hayatımın altının üstünden daha güzel olduğunu biliyorum çünkü sen varsın .Sözlerimi bir iltifatla bitiriyorum . Gözlerin, gözleriniz hanımefendi sanki bir müze çünkü böyle bir şaheseri taşıyorlar , doğum günün kutlu olsun saman sarısı :)):      “aşağıya  Zeynep’in beni sevmesini isteyenler kendi dillerinde ben yazsın…”",Positive

"I remember when I was in sixth grade and I had the hugest crush on a boy, we met because of my substitute teacher due to changing my crushs seat next to mine and that's where it all began. We were best friends, he showed mixed signs, always asked for paper (to throw paper balls at his friends or me) and gave me notes and whispered in my ear something one time but I knew I could make out the word ""Ur Cute"". All of my friends were shipping me and him, he dated 2 girls that year which broke my heart. He always asked who did I like but I never found a way to tell him that I liked him. He teased me, and I even had the courage to ask for his number. (and I never talked to him because I was too scared.) Now, I'm in 7th grade. He is only in my first period, and he doesn't interact with me, or even look at me anymore. I've cried over him many times..... but ever since summer vacation our friendship was gone. I wish I told him I liked him earlier. This song always reminds me of him.",Positive

Not asking you to be submissive. I'm asking you to support the right way. Buying albums, streaming, articles, getting on radio. This is real support. If you want to bring hate because you think bts is too powerful and can't crumble, doesn't has social media and doesn't know about the hate I suggest you get out of my post. They know about it all. They keep it in. You recklessly bring more, and then tell you'll protect them. You can't protect them unless you take their phones and throw it down the gutter so they won't know about negative opinions. ]",Neutral
