"Just like Eminem (Marshall Mathers) my music or my songs are not all literal. - By Tamara O’Connell p.s. I’ll let people guess and pick it all apart and come to their own conclusions like the open ending in the Christopher Nolan movie ‘Inception’ starring Leonardo DiCaprio. I had to watch ‘Inception’ many times, but I finally figured out the ending this year. - By Tamara O’Connell xoxo p.s. I’ll always want the best for my old friend 🇨🇴 JJ Villamizar, but I know it’s over. Not game over. I’d never play with JJ’s heart. And I’d never want to hurt him or cause him pain. Not intentionally. It’s just over. This chapter anyway. Our stories continue..we must go on JJ in our new worlds.  Just don’t forget me. Every time you look up into the night sky and see a star  or the Southern Hemisphere star constellation called the ‘Southern Cross’ think of me. And send me a postcard from Colombia 🇨🇴 someday.
