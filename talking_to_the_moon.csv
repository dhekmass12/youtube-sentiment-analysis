"Damn.....this hurt. It's been 3 years since the divorce and there isnt even one night I havent thought of her. It's not obsessive or possessive. It was real love and the thoughts are mostly of happy moments from the time we spent together. I cherish those memories because they were true moments in love and at the same time those memories tear me up inside because i know we could have been together forever. I fucked up by not being there emotionally and it wreaks me constantly because i could've been better, i could've been the best version of myself. Why did I have to become that outside of our marriage, our deep friendship, our everlasting connection? I am the fool. I know I am only talking to the moon. I wish I could tell you how much I still love you, I wish I could say that you finding another man that takes care of you emotionally makes me cry with joy. He was the man I could not be at that time. I still love you so much that I'm not mad, jealous or sad that you found that. I still love you so much that when I even get a glance of one of our pictures from the wedding that I dont even mean to look at I still get butterflies. ",Positive

"The way this song speaks to me... as someone who has lost a very dear loved one, it hits differently. ""Cause when the sun goes down, they're talking back."" To me, it sounds as though the person still living becomes someone who tries to drink away the pain. So much so that they truly hear the sound of their loved one talking back to them. ""In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too or am I fool?"" Some have faith and believe in heaven, but no one truly knows where we go when we die. It seems as though they are simply grieving and hoping their loved one is out there somewhere able to hear them. At least that's how I perceive this song.",Neutral
