"There's something about this song that just awakens a part of me that so rarely ever comes out. I can't make it all the way through it without crying by the final chorus and I'm not ashamed by it at all. So far, I've yet to lose anyone quite like the lost loved one described here, but I have lost many that I've cared about, and this song really has a way of letting the grief I could never truly feel in those moments out. What a beautiful melody. It now stands as the soundtrack to my work in-progress novel from the very day it began. I look forward to returning here again whenever I need to let that grief out. To my family in the stars, you are missed, you are loved, you are remembered.",Neutral

"Something that happened it was bad. I was sad. I’m just on my mom‘s account and I’m a kid. I’m only seven years old. Don’t make fun of me because I’m really sad. This song reminded me of it cause one time when I was really little I was like four or three and when I was like boy, I think now I was little and I hated my babies because they got my eyes all the time that was like your hair I cut it. It turned out bad and I wanted to go say hi but I just remembered I said oh no my hair. I’m gonna make fun of me so I want to go call him and say hi but they didn’t make fun of me because they were good people and then when I was six, I have my grandma and I called her Maga so I was in my room watching my iPad just watching YouTube scrolling down TikTok into my Maga called me over. I went just in case it was something that and she said look out the window I looked out. My friends house was on fire all I made it out. I got that happened, but the house was destroyed a lot so they had to move away, and I thought I would never see them again, but one time when I was at my cousins house they live right by us so I could go to the house walk so I was there one time in my I was in my aunt room and my cousin Alexis walked over she’s nine years old and I forgot what her birthday is but yeah and she said you know your friends across the friends yeah and I’m like yeah I know that I’m never seeing them again. I know that if they they moved, how am I supposed to know if they’re going? I’m gonna see them see them like there’s no way I’m seeing them and she said I found out the people that on my group for softball your friends on my team and I’m like please get out please get out. I was on my phone with one of my friends. Her name is Violet and yeah and Then I started crying a lot but like happy tears because I was gonna see them again and then I told my friend about it I got some tissue to wipe the tears off blow my nose she said are you OK and I’m like yeah but I’m just happy that I’m gonna see them again. I’m sad like happy tears and when I go again, I told like the middle one remember me she said yeah when he was Alexis‘s first game and then when I saw the little one, I said, I know you don’t she said yeah and I don’t remember if I have to but she’s or she is on her team again I know what I’m gonna do. I’m gonna hug them really tight because I saw them again and I’m hungry I’m so tired, but crying silently, and if one of my friends that would cross the fence, watching me are going to close my eyes and be silent crying, and I would be saying in my head. I’m so glad I asked you my cousin said that they want the team and now they are on it again. I’m so happy I got to see them. I thought I would never see them again, but when I saw them and made my day.🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹",Neutral
