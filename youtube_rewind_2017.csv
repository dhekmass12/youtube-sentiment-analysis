"bro lowkey this makes me feel so nostalgic like i feel like things were so easier in 2017 and under. everything felt so peaceful compared to the present-day US. Like of course there were problems going on as the world is never really 100% peaceful, but it was so nice to just be a kid in 2017. I can't speak for everyone of course, but 2017 was really a bounce back year for me after I had lost my grandma and 3 dogs the year prior and was still upset about all of them. So, when 2017 came around, I tried my best to be a better person in spite of respective loss and pain. This was a great year for me, and I feel like if YouTube were to start doing these again, everyone who saw them before would appreciate them for nostalgic reasons. Even thinking about the 2018 Rewind, of course it's still funny, but it's truly become something that I know I've grown to love and reminisce about. Also, seeing KSI in this after Thick of It.. Umm.. Not sure if I miss that entirely....",Neutral
